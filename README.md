# CMPE250 Projects

This repository contains projects and implementations from the **CMPE 250**, where I learned essential concepts of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, including sorting methods, graphs, and problem-solving techniques.
All of the data structures used in the projects are manually implemented by myself, only used built-in ArrayList structure in Java. 

## Overview

The projects in this repository cover various fundamental and advanced DSA topics, such as:

- **Data Structures:** Arrays, lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, graphs, hash tables, and more.
- **Algorithms:** Searching (binary search, linear search), sorting (quick sort, merge sort, bubble sort, etc.), recursion, and greedy algorithms.
- **Graph Theory:** Graph representations, BFS, DFS, shortest paths (Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall), and minimum spanning trees (Kruskal, Prim).

## Repository Structure

Each project is stored in a separate folder containing:
- **Source Code:** .java files related to projects.
- **Documentation:** A folder containing the description of the projects.
- **Testcases:** Example inputs and outputs for validation.
